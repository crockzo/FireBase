FireBaseDatabase  mDataBase :  is used to point to the data base of the connected account

DatabaseReference mRef : this used to refer the database node


#this is to get the instance of the database
mDataBase = mDataBase.getInstance();

#this command will  give the reference of the parent/root node of the data base
mRef = mDataBase.getReference();

#this command will give the reference of the specified node
mRef = mDataBase.getReference("user!");


#to access the value of the refered node we set a listener to the node
mRef.addValueEventListener() ---> this will listen when the value is added or updated AND when the data is removed
        #with in this function we have two major function
            1. onDataChange(DataSnapshot ds);
            #this will take the snapshot of the data base node and through this we can access the value of the referenced node
                #through DataSnapshot we can read the data from the database
                ds.getValue(String.class);

            2. onCancelled(DataBaseError dbe);
            #this will invoked when the value of the node is deleted or an error is occured


#to create the reference of the child node
mRef = mDataBase.getReference("child");

#to access the value of the refered node we set a listener to the node
mRef.addValueEventListener() ---> this will listen when the value is added or updated AND when the data is removed
        #with in this function we have two major function
            1. onDataChange(DataSnapshot ds);
            #this will take the snapshot of the data base node and through this we can access the value of the referenced node
                #through DataSnapshot we can read the data from the database
                ds.getValue(String.class);

            2. onCancelled(DataBaseError dbe);
            #this will invoked when the value of the node is deleted or an error is occured


#another way to create the child is by
mRef.child("child_name");

#to access this data we use
mRed.child("child_name").addValueEventListener() -----> then same process
